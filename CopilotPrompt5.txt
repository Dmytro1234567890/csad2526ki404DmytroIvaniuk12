GitHub Actions workflow in YAML. Name: Cross-Platform CMake CI. Trigger on push/pull_request to branches containing 'develop' or 'master'. Create a job 'cross_build' that uses a strategy matrix to run on 'ubuntu-latest', 'windows-latest', and 'macos-latest'. The steps must check out the code, run the CI script ci.sh or ci.bat depending on the OS, and then execute a deploy step.
